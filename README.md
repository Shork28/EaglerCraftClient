  I'm new to this just a high schooler so if you have any suggestions as to what I should do then please tell me!!!

  But, in simple terms for this to work open the Google.Classroom file is located above this. Click on the button next to copy the raw file button. YOu should get a notification that it has been downloaded! press Ctrl and o. Navigate to the file and open it.   

  There isn't a single player YET, I might add it later idk I'm kinda lazy...

  Once you've chosen your username skin etc., go to multiplayer and open the servers list I have provided :).
